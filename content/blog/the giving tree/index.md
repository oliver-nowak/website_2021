In these images from 2005, I constructed abstract scenes with medium-format slide film.

I wanted to step out of my comfort zone of using black&white film, and instead, explore the wide world of color. These are my first color photographs.

At the time, I had grown to love (and missed) the graininess from pushed [Ilford Delta 3200 black and white film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilford_Delta "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilford_Delta"). So I added digital noise to degrade the images.

Image degradation seems to be a constant theme in my work. I'm not sure why other than I really detested the razor sharp, clean and perfect images other photographers were making. It felt so inauthentic to me. So "Pop". I much preferred the damage; the evidence of mediation; the characterful nature of an authentic existence that resulted in scars and stories.

That sentiment has definitely carried over through the years.
