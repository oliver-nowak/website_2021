I created these images between 2002 - 2005.

Many of them are [lith prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lith_print "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lith_print").

At least one apartment wood floor was irreparably harmed during the making of these images.

The thumbnail image is a medium-format Polaroid image. I was checking the light exposure and loved how the Polaroid became distressed as I peeled the film.

Everything was shot with a [Mamiya RB67 camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamiya_RB67 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamiya_RB67"). Everything is in-camera and analog. No digital tricks.

Some of the images are very obviously projected into a CRT television via camcorder before the image was taken. I was experimenting with the pixel "smearing" that occurs as a property of this kind of technology.

Generally, I would spend Friday nights in the "studio". I never had a predefined notion of what I wanted to make. I would just set up the camera, throw some light on the table, and then improvise through the viewfinder. Over time, I amassed a large assortment of props and material to work with to make the improvisation easier.

Once the image was taken, I would spend Saturday night developing the film and then printing it on the enlarger I kept set up in the living room.

I'm not quite sure why I settled on nails as a subject. Or why I started anthropomorphizing them. I think it was because I liked the shape and how it bisected the horizon. And it's representation as an industrial object; both a result of an industrialized process, but also participating in one. I found that dichotomy interesting.
