This series from 2007 uses ordinary household objects to conflate the still-life, the landscape and the portrait into one image.

Everything you see is done 'in-camera'.

No digital manipulation was used to create these pictures.

By juxtaposing hardware into a landscape, I suggest a fruitful symbiosis between nature and the constructed, the digital and the analog, truth as we see it & truth as we know it.

Now, these kinds of images can be done with AI. And would likely look a lot better.

For me, the process of creating a landscape still-life that was indistinguishable from the real thing was super interesting. I wanted to test the viewer's perception of what was really Real. And then subvert that with a common industrial object.
