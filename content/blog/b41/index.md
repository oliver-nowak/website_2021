This video was created in 2007 as part of an exploration into video-based practice.

It's not very good. But, I find it interesting because it does have traces of various cultural influences that have informed my work: [William Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs"), [Skinny Puppy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_Puppy "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_Puppy") (performing as [Download](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_(band)> "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_(band)")), [cut-up methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique"), music videos, and various juxtapositions of "Reality" with the fantastical.
