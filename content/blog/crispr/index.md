description: pixel splicing various pictures of objects together, programmatically
---

I generated these images in 2009 using bespoke software I had written.

One was an adaptation of the Processing example program that converts an image into ASCII based on its luminance. The other was a program I had written for my MFA thesis called the [_pixel-splicer_](https://github.com/oliver-nowak/pixel_splicer "https://github.com/oliver-nowak/pixel_splicer").

I wanted to create images that merged the techniques of these two programs as a way to reveal the essential nature of the Subject of the image. I also wanted to perforate my idea of an image that has some indexical connection to Reality by foregrounding The Pixel.
