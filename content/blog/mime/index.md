description: a collision of photographic processes and mechanical reproduction.

This is another exploration into leveraging the photographic medium and its processes in a confrontation with its representation.

These images were created in 2008 using a wide variety of legacy photographic processes alongside newer, more modern pixel-based interactions.

[Albumen prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumen_print "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumen_print"), [Salt prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_print "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_print"), [silver-halide chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin_silver_process "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin_silver_process") -- these were just a few of the analog processes I used to create these images.

On the digital side of things, I was still using my _pixel-splicer_ software to generate the source images.
