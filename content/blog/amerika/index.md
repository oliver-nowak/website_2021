These photographs were taken in NYC between 2005 - 2007 while I was getting my MFA at the School of Visual Arts.

Occasionally, I would venture into the city and wander. These images are all shot on film. Some are shot on [slide film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-6_process "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-6_process"), some on [C-41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-41_process "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-41_process"); others, [Ilford Delta 3200 B&W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilford_Delta "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilford_Delta").

Since it was only a few years after 9/11, I was attuned to the surveillance apparatus everywhere.

The title references an [old TV miniseries](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_(miniseries)> "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_(miniseries)") from the 80's about the Soviet occupation of the US. The title was meant sarcastically; and yet, here we are. I suppose, in a way, I was just as complicit in creating the imposed atmosphere.

Since then, the idea of "Privacy" has been obliterated in favor of an editorialized, documentary mode of culture called Social Media.

It is ironic to me that the desire to be seen has also become just as prevalent through social media in our disembodied digital culture.
