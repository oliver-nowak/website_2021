description: The first album of the 'kidneys optional' music project. Drawing on influences ranging from barrelhouse blues, jump blues, boogie woogie and old-skool WaxTrax-era industrial, the album weaves a rich tapestry of piano-based instrumentals that evoke a bygone era while updating it for the 21st century.

i'm not vain enough to think i can contribute meaningfully.

or good enough to offer originality.

or confident enough to provide entertainment.

at best, i'm a negative zero.

which -- honestly -- i'm better suited for than the alternatives on either side of that scale.
