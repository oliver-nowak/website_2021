When faced with the obvious, we second-guess ourselves.

â€”to make sure.

This is The Fear expressed as skepticism.

We all make mistakes, right?

But when the obvious hits us squarely, we take note: and then deny its very existence. Because to acknowledge it is to face living in oblivion.

The denial works. Life goes on. With or without you.

We reach for technology to preserve our Continuity.

Surely, you would notice its interruption. And your paranoia, validated.

Continuity is important to you. You need it. It becomes the bulwark against the deterioration that occurs on the edges of your perception.

I can see it in the way you clench your teeth when you look under the couch for SaranWrap to cover your laundry, or you can't find your credit card to purchase the same brown handbag for the twentieth time.

Dementia feasts on your precious memories.

And so we're left with the wreckage that has become your Continuity. And we try to survive.

...

For Mother.
