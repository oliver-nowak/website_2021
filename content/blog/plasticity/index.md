These are manipulated photographs. I created them between 2006 - 2007 as a reaction to the documentary perspective that was prevalent at the time. I wanted to express my interest in dystopic cyberpunk transhumanism. I really liked the images I was seeing on album covers from `Download` or `Frontline Assembly`.

The title references a short-film that was made in 2000 based on a script I had written. Thematically, they are closely related.

All the images were shot on a 5MP Olympus digital camera and then composited with Photoshop and a Wacom tablet. It took hours.

I have some of these images as 20 inch prints, and, even though they were 5MP images, they hold up ok on the wall.

It was also instrumental in getting me an Aaron Siskind Fellowship Grant in [2009](https://lenscratch.com/2009/06/oliver-nowak/).
