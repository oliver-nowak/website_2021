The film was made possible through the herculean effort of the director, Brian Forrest. He got a pretty big grant (in the 10's of K's) and then made the film happen.

It was all shot on 35mm over a weekend. Some changes to the script were necessary in order to adapt it to the screen.

I never thought he would actually make it happen. He had seen the original play at the University of Iowa and asked if he could adapt it as a short-film. Of course, I said yes.

A few years later, I'm living in a suburb south of Cincinatti, and get a call from him telling me he got the funding.

He submitted the film to a bunch of regional film festivals and actually won an award or two.

Thematically, this film touches on a lot of my interests: junk technology, transhumanism, what it means to be human in the face of technological upheaval.

I really liked the synthy soundtrack. Brian made something special here.
