in the summer of `22, i drove across the country to visit my mother in iowa for a wellness check.

after she had been fired from Walmart, she had become reclusive, and, by all reports, had confined herself to the couch waiting out the rest of her life.

i found her there, asleep, ashtrays full, surrounded by empty soda cans and potato chip crumbs. crushed empty cigarette packs littering the moat between the couch and the coffee table.

she had sores all over; barely lucid, except to light a cigarette and change the channel on the tv.

there were packages from amazon, never opened, stacked in the front porch.

and, near her bed, old bandages.
