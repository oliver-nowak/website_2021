description: Louis LePrince's Roundhay Garden (1888) is credited as the earliest motion picture. This single-channel video divides the frame into 'zones' - one zone per frame. Each zone is set to its relative frame. For example, the second zone is set to frame #2, the third zone to frame #3, etc.<br><br>The film is begun and the individual frames cycle through the sum of all frames from their respective starting point.
