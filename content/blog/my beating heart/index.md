Another 2008 exploration into the concept of [_pixel-splicing_](https://github.com/oliver-nowak/pixel_splicer "https://github.com/oliver-nowak/pixel_splicer"). But this time, expanding the scope out of the individual frames, into something more directed and authored.

[Louis LePrince's Roundhay Garden (1888)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhay_Garden_Scene "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhay_Garden_Scene") is credited as the earliest motion picture. This single-channel video divides the frame into 'zones' - one zone per frame. Each zone is set to its relative frame. For example, the second zone is set to frame #2, the third zone to frame #3, etc.

The film is begun and the individual frames cycle through the sum of all frames from their respective starting point.
