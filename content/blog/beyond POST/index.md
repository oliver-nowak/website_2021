This video was supposed to be my pre-thesis year summary analysis of my work so far (in 2007).

However, ironically the motherboard on my computer fried the day before my presentation, resulting in a shorter, more traditional, more reliable paper-based report.

The title references the POST sequence that computers run to check themselves for hardware failure.
